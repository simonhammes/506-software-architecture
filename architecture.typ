= Introduction
This document contains the software architecture for a real-life software
inspired by Scotland Yard, which is a board game where players work together as
detectives to track down the elusive criminal, Mr. X, in London. Mr. X moves
secretly around the city using different modes of transportation while the
detectives try to deduce his whereabouts. The detectives must strategically plan
their moves to corner Mr. X and make an arrest before he escapes. Mr. X reveals
his location periodically, adding suspense and challenge to the game. The game
combines deduction, strategy, and teamwork as players race against time to
capture Mr. X.
